              Censoring is a time-consuming job for journalists and video editors today, so we decided to create a
              function for automatic face censoring. With our new feature, Vimond IO users will be able to select
              faces through computer vision and face detection, and easily blur the faces in the matter of seconds.
              This will save the users a lot of time, and hence, add a great deal of value. We have also added some
              other features that we found useful. Our design choices were mostly based on the design principles
              consistency, affordance and feedback.

              When gathering insight we spoke with Vimond IO users at Tv2, and tried to learn more about their
              workflow. Which functionalities are they satisfied with? Which functionalities do they miss? What
              can be better? We also conducted interviews with the in-house team working at Vimond IO at Vimond.
              What are the most common feedback they get from Vimond IO users? How can we make sure that our
              research regarding time-based metadata results in the highest value information possible for Vimond?

              With the insight we had gathered we started a Google Design Sprint. The next following days,
              we spent time using different methods as ‘how might we’s', setting long-term goals, selecting
              target area, sketching and low-fidelity prototyping. With this, we had a prototype to test.
              With the feedback we got from testing, we continued with an iteration sprint where we created new and
              more specific questions, we mapped and created a storyboard. Now we were able to start making
              a high-fidelity prototype by using the prototyping tool Figma. With our prototype we had a
              finished product, and we were able to test and observe users, and get further ideas on improvement.
