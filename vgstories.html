          </div>
          <div class="vgA">
            <a>The media house VG has a digital news platform on Snapchat, where they are publishing
              colums consisting of a collection of short news elements. By using bodily measurments tools, we performed
              usertests to figure out to what degree VG's column on Snapchat was designed for optimal user experiences.
              To perform this test we used eyetracking glasses (Tobii Pro Glasses) and a wristband collecting real-time
              physiological data (Empatica E4).

              <h3>RESULT</h3>
              After analysing the data gathered by usertesting, we found four main findings; the format was stressfull,
              it had a lack of overview of different functions, the icons used was at some time confusing, and too many
              elements were appearing on the same time. This data was based on both the physiological data gathered by the
              glasses and the wristband, and also through interviews. We concluded with the design of VG's news platform
              on Snapchat being complex and not designed for good user experiences.
